<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>This track displays locations of predominant polyadenylation sites and predominant polyadenylation hexamers for almsot 16,000 protein coding genes. PolyA Sites and hexamers were derived from the PolyA Site 2.0 database. PolyA sites were filtered for protein coding genes. The predominant polyA site was defined as the polyA site that is used in more than 50% of a geneâ€™s transcripts. For each site, predominant polyA hexamers were selected depending on the strength of the candidate hexamer as well as the distance of the candidate hexamer to the -21 position from representative polyA site. This track is available in hg38 and hg19.</p>
